<h2>Propagating Leaves : User Scenario Mapping</h2>
<h2>Scenario:</h2>
<section>Ken works a full-time job and isn't home all the time. 
    He wants to start a hobby in raising houseplants. However, he wants a beginner 
    friendly plant that doesn't require intense care and doesn't require direct sunlight 
    as his apartment is facing east. He browses online for a plant shop and find Propagating 
    Leaves, which has a filter for light, water, and what level of skill is suggested. He 
    finds a golden pothos, which can survive any lighting and requires very minimal care. 
    When his order arrives, it comes with starter instructions and a starter pot.</section>
